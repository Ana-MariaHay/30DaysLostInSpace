 * 30 Days - Lost in Space
 * Day 8B - Adding some color to this dark place (Common Anode version)

 * Learn more at https://inventr.io/adventure
 *
 * Previously we have used different color LEDs with our HERO, but when we require
 * more output, or desire a color different from the available colors we use a more
 * flexible "RGB LED".  RGB LEDs have a red, a green and a blue LED packaged into a
 * single LED package.  By using something called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) we
 * can vary the intensity of each LED and come up a wide variety of colors.
 *
 * NOTE: On rare occasions a different type of RGB LED has been found by users,
 *       cause either by supplier mixup or because the customer used an outside
 *       source and received a different part.
 *
 *       The part in the inventr.io kit is a "Common Cathode" RGB LED, where the
 *       common lead is connected to GND.  In a "Common Anode" RGB LED the common
 *       lead is connected to Vcc (5V on the HERO) and each color is connected to
 *       GND in order to light the part.  This sketch modifies the code to work
 *       with Common Anode RGB LEDs.
 *
 *       Since we created our own function to control the LEDs, all of the changes
 *       necessary to control a Common Anode RGB LED can be made in a single place
 *       instead of having to change all values used in the loop().  See additional
 *       notes in the displayColor() method at the end of the sketch.

 * displayColor() is a function that accepts three parameters representing the desired

 * be included on a single line like:
 * void displayColor( uint8_t red_intensity, uint8_t green_intensity, uint8_t blue_intensity) {
