| 1         | Today, we're diving deeper into the fascinating world of coding with our HERO board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       |
| 2         | We are about to explore a new program, also known as a "sketch". This is somewhat similar to the Blink sketch we familiarized ourselves with on Day 1. However, we have evolved it to control an external LED and it is well annotated to guide you through each feature of the Arduino C++ language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
| 3         | Let's start with a fundamental yet non-executable aspect of our program, the "comments". These lines are the guiding stars of any code, offering insights and understanding to anyone who examines the code, including your future self.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| 4         | Comments can either span a single line or multiple lines. Our focus initially will be on multi-line comments seen at the beginning of our Day 2 sketch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |
| 5         | To begin a multi-line comment, we use a special character sequence: a slash followed directly by an asterisk, without any intervening space. You'll find this at the start of our sketch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| 6         | This beginning sequence and all the following content will be disregarded by the compiler, until it encounters the ending sequence, which is an asterisk followed by a slash. This can occur anywhere in our sketch, even many lines down from the beginning sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| 7         | To make it easier to spot, it's advised to keep these sequences on lines by themselves, despite the compiler being able to identify them even in the middle of a line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |
| 8         | In order to enhance readability, each line of our multi-line comment starts with an asterisk. This is more for aesthetics and is not a requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |
| 9         | Our initial block of multi-line comments introduces the sketch, a practice we will maintain throughout this course for easy identification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| 10        | For convenient reading, the Arduino IDE enables you to collapse lengthy comments after reading them. You'll notice a special "down pointer" appearing where the multi-line comment commences, allowing you to hide the comment with a click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| 11        | This action conceals multiple lines, indicating concealed content with a trailing ellipsis, or three dots. To revisit the hidden content, another click in the same spot will do the trick. A neat feature, isn't it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |
| 12        | Let's keep the first comment collapsed as we navigate to the subsequent block of comments in this sketch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |

For now, we'll collapse this section to proceed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |

| 1         | Now, unveiling a coding secret - it's a rarity for programmers to craft all their code from scratch. Instead, we lean heavily on the wealth of code penned by fellow programmers, integrating it into our sketches via compiler directives. These directives, starting with a hashtag (#), facilitate the inclusion of extensive codes from other files into our sketch without the cumbersome process of copy-pasting.                                            |       |
| 2         | Noteworthy here is the automatic inclusion of the "Arduino.h" file by the Arduino IDE. Including this file manually not only enables compatibility with other IDEs but also serves as a reminder of this inclusion, hence its recommendation in all your sketches.                                                                                                                                            |       |
| 3         | Leveraging included files transcends mere consolidation, as it automates the update process, ensuring your sketch always utilizes the latest version without manual interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |
| 4         | Further, it allows for precise version control based on your folder structure, facilitating seamless board support and version selection by the Arduino IDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| 5         | Recalling the "LED_BUILTIN" from the initial Blink sketch, its pin allocation differs across boards. This adaptive functionality stems from the appropriate selection of the "Arduino.h" file, ensuring universal compatibility.                                                                                                                                                                            |       |

| 1         | Post the collapse of the preceding comment, we encounter the most comprehensive comment section in this sketch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| 2         | As with the "LED_BUILTIN" feature, the Arduino IDE enables us to assign names to constants, these being values that remain unchanged throughout the sketch's execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |
| 3         | Incorporating constants comes with myriad advantages, detailed in this extensive comment section. To encapsulate, it facilitates simplified and error-free coding, with two primary declaration methods: the #define directive and the "const" variable declaration.                                                                                                                                                                         |       |
| 4         | Despite the prevalent use of #define, opting for the const declaration minimizes potential compile issues and debugging complexities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |
| 5         | Both methods support mixed-case naming; however, the convention dictates the use of UPPER CASE for constants to distinguish them from variable names which may vary during program execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |       |
| 6         | In this sketch, we define a constant representing the cabin lights control pin on our lander. Given its external location on the HERO board, we'll designate pin 12 for this function, defining it in our sketch as the "CABIN_LIGHTS_PIN" with a value of 12.                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| 7         | Employing the "const" keyword allows for data type specification, with "uint8_t" representing an unsigned 8-bit integer suitable for small values such as 12. This selection ensures optimal memory utilization, as it employs only a byte of memory space.                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |
| 8         | Subsequent sections will delve deeper into the attributes of constants, offering you a comprehensive understanding of this fundamental aspect of programming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |

| 1         | As we inch closer to executing our first advanced sketch, it's crucial to understand the initial setup procedure that's an integral part of every Arduino sketch. The `setup()` function, as the name suggests, sets up the environment for our sketch to run successfully. |       |
| 2         | Within the `setup()` function, you will find the `pinMode` function, an important tool that allows us to define the behavior of each pin on the Arduino. In today's sketch, we'll use it to set the `CABIN_LIGHTS_PIN` as an OUTPUT. |       |
| 3         | Grasping the concept of `pinMode` is fundamental to interacting with the physical elements connected to the Arduino, such as LEDs, motors, and sensors.                                                              |       |
| 4         | Next, we have the `digitalWrite` function, employed here to initially set the cabin lights to a LOW state, effectively turning them off as the sketch starts.                                                          |       |
| 5         | This sets the stage for the next segment of our sketch, where the actual "action" begins. Before we proceed, take a moment to ponder how these functions create a solid foundation for the dynamic behavior we aim to code in the subsequent steps. |       |

|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1         | Having laid a strong foundation in the setup phase, we now transition into the `loop()` function, the heart of our Arduino sketch where all the dynamic actions are coded.                                                              |       |
| 2         | The `loop()` function, as you might infer from its name, houses codes that run in a continuous loop, allowing for ongoing interaction with the connected components.                                                                    |       |
| 3         | The first line inside the `loop()` function contains the `digitalWrite` function again, but this time it sets the cabin lights to a HIGH state, turning them on. This showcases how a single function can have versatile roles within a sketch. |       |
| 4         | Subsequently, we introduce a delay with the `delay` function, providing a pause that lasts for a specified number of milliseconds. This creates a visible delay before the next line of code is executed, giving a breathing space between turning the light on and off. |       |
| 5         | Following the delay, we utilize the `digitalWrite` function yet again, this time to set the cabin lights to a LOW state, turning them off and showcasing a simple but effective example of automation.                                           |       |
| 6         | To give a complete cycle, we introduce another delay before the loop iterates again, creating a rhythmic flashing of the cabin lights.                                                                                                    |       |
| 7         | This cycling process forms the essence of automation, illustrating how a few lines of code can control physical components dynamically, bringing our HERO board to life in a pulsating dance of lights.                                  |       |
| 8         | As we wrap up today's session, feel free to experiment with different delay values to alter the rhythm of the lights, fostering a hands-on understanding of how changes in the code affect the physical world.                               |       |
| 9         | We encourage you to explore and make this sketch your own. Remember, the journey of becoming a proficient programmer is filled with experimentation and learning from the outcomes.                                                          |       |
