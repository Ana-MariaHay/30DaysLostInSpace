The video titled "Day 9" from the playlist you provided is a continuation of the course that guides the viewer through the process of operating a rescue craft using primitive 21st-century computers and electronics. Here are the key learning points from the video:

1. The video starts with a discussion on the progress made in getting the power systems up and running on a rescue shuttle. The telemetry readings indicate that the components necessary for the power systems are functioning properly. The text mentions the success in getting the analog light detection, serial monitor, and pulse width modulated LED controls functioning properly. The next step is to put everything together and complete the battery charging utility.

2. The video introduces the concept of variables and how they are used in code. It mentions the use of integer variables to represent values such as sensor pins and onboard LEDs. The text also mentions the setup and loop routines, with a focus on reading analog sensor pins and writing information to the serial monitor.

3. The video discusses the use of milliseconds to change the amount of time before interrogations of a circuit. It explains that defining the time in the code allows for easy modification in one location. The text also introduces the use of double variables, which can represent decimal numbers.

4. The video discusses the concept of a double precision number, which has twice as many bits as a float. It explains that a double precision variable can go up to 10 to the 308th power, which is a very large number. The text also mentions using double precision to calculate battery charge levels and introduces the idea of defining custom functions in code.

5. The video discusses a new function called "print battery percentage void" and explains that it does not return a numerical value but instead prints the value of ticks, which represents the elapsed time. The text also mentions that the function prints the value of milliseconds and then calculates the battery level as a percentage of battery capacity.

6. The video discusses the process of calculating and printing the battery percentage. It mentions using a function to repeatedly perform this task and emphasizes the importance of understanding the actions taken in response to the information obtained from the circuit.

7. The video discusses a construction that involves adding the battery level to the sensor value and putting it back into the battery level. This statement is shorthand for a loop that continuously increases the battery level based on the current sensor value. The rate at which the battery level increases depends on the brightness of the light falling on the photoreistor.

8. The video concludes by discussing the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) to manipulate digital outputs and create color-coded information. The author suggests experimenting with different combinations and color combinations to find what works best. They also mention using PWM to indicate battery charging levels.

9. The author decides to cover up the photoreistor to prevent immediate charging and then uncover it to see if increasing the light changes the charging rate. They upload the code and observe a slowly rising charge on the serial monitor. They expect the red LED to shift to yellow when the charge reaches 25%.

10. The author uncovers the sensor and sees that the charging rate is increasing faster. They reach 10% and anticipate crossing the 25% threshold soon. The text ends with the mention of 20% and 25% charge levels and the switch to a yellow LED.

11. The video describes the process of switching to a different level and mode of operation, and the successful completion of building a battery charging utility. It encourages the reader to customize and work on their own projects, and mentions that the next problem will be tackled soon.
