The video titled "Day 4" from the playlist you provided is a continuation of the course that guides the viewer through the process of operating a rescue craft using primitive 21st-century computers and electronics. Here are the key learning points from the video:

1. The video starts with a discussion on the recent activity on the craft and the need to be careful with power consumption. They plan to work on extending the capabilities of the craft, specifically focusing on coding to control multiple lighting circuits.

2. The video discusses the use of a single LED with three different LEDs. The LEDs are labeled as LED1, LED2, and LED3, corresponding to output pins on the hardware. The switches on the dip switch will be used as inputs to control the LEDs.

3. The viewer is guided on how to set up input and output pins in code. It explains that pins 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the outputs LED 1, 2, and 3. It also mentions that pins 10, 11, and 12 will be assigned as output functions.

4. The video discusses a code that controls the behavior of switches and lights. The code checks the voltage on certain pins and executes different actions based on the voltage level. If the voltage is high, it turns on a specific light, and if it is low, it turns off the light.

5. The video discusses a circuit that is three times more complicated than the previous one. The author plans to carefully examine the different parts of the circuit, starting with the dip switch and input functions. They explain that the inputs to the circuit require a steady 5 volts, which is provided through an orange wire.

6. The video describes the process of connecting resistors and switches in a circuit. It mentions the use of zero volts and ground, as well as the connection of wires and pins. The author also discusses the debugging process and the connection of LED lights.

7. The video describes the successful upload of a code to a device called "the hero." The switches on the device are all in the off position, which is good news. The text then discusses testing the code by turning on different switches and observing the corresponding LEDs. The logic in the code is confirmed to be working correctly.

8. The video concludes by mentioning future contact and the importance of building and inventing safely.
