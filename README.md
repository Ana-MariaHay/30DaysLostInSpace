*Your 30 Day Coding And Circuits Challenge To Bring You From Beginner To Builder*

## Story Synopsis:

Explorer?  Explorer?  Suit AI here.  Are you awake?  

It is good that you are functional.  The ship appears to have contacted the surface of this planet at a higher than optimal velocity.

I took it upon myself to run a complete diagnostic and have determined that the ship's computer suffered a catastrophic failure as we approached our targetted landing zone causing the hard landing.  Luckily, we hit the ocean surface rather than land, but it also means we're currently on the sea bottom.

Other than the ship's computer I detect little damage.  But since the ship's systems are all operated by the ship's computer not much is currently working.

Good news, we have a repair kit on board.  Bad news, it appears to be a *bit* out of date with older technology.  However, the HERO board is more than capable of operating the ship systems once we provide the instructions and connect it to the rest of the ship.

I'm sure that with my holographic help you'll be able to restore the ship's systems, successfully launch this ship and return home safely.

Shall we begin?
